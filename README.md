# quiz

For this project, I created a Bartending Quiz with a countdown timer.  The quiz has 10 questions and the user has 2 minutes (displayed in seconds) to answer all 10 questions.  The questions present one at a time and the timer is displayed with a countdown.  If they answer the question correctly, the next question displays. But, if they answer incorrectly, they still move to the next question but 10 seconds is taken off of the timer.  The quiz ends, and time stops, when all questions are answered or the timer runs out.  At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to input their initials which are then stored and displayed with their time in the "High Scores" section of the page.  I used HTML to create the base structure and features of the page, added CSS to style the page, and utilized Javascript to manipulate the quiz: controling the questions that are displayed, the timer, and logging the high scores.
